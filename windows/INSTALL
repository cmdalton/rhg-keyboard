Note that, due to system limitations, the language for this keyboard will be listed as Română (Moldova) or Romanian (Moldova).

To install the Rohingya Hanifi keyboard for windows:

1. Double click the setup.exe file in the rhg-keyb folder.

(Steps 2-8 are only necessary for Windows 10 users)

2. Click on the Start button and click "Settings" (the gear icon).

3. Select "Time & Language," then click on "Additional date, time, & regional settings" under "Related settings" to access the Control Panel.

4. Click "Language."

5. Click "Advanced settings."

6. Under "Switching input methods," check the box next to "Use the desktop language bar when it's available."

7. Click "Save."

You should now be able to switch to the Rohingya Hanifi keyboard. Again, it will show up as Română (Moldova) or Romanian (Moldova).
